Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and mathematics that arranges a collection of elements in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. The elements to be sorted can be numbers, strings, or any other comparable data. Sorting is essential in various applications, including databases, search algorithms, and data analysis.

There are two main categories of sorting algorithms: stable sorting and unstable sorting. The primary difference between them lies in how they handle equal elements. In a stable sort, the relative order of equal elements remains the same before and after sorting, whereas in an unstable sort, the relative order of equal elements is not guaranteed to be preserved.

Stable Sorting:

In stable sorting, if you have two elements with equal keys, their original order in the input will be maintained in the sorted output. A common example of a stable sorting algorithm is Bubble Sort. For instance, if you have a list of students sorted by name using a stable sort and then sorted by age, students with the same name will still be ordered by age in the final sorted list.

Unstable Sorting:

Unstable sorting algorithms do not guarantee that the relative order of equal elements in the input will be preserved in the sorted output. A common example of an unstable sorting algorithm is QuickSort. In the same example of a list of students sorted by name and then age, an unstable sort might rearrange students with the same name in any order when sorting by age.

Examples:

1. Stable Sorting Example:
   Imagine you have a list of cards with the same face value but different suits (e.g., Ace of Spades, Ace of Hearts, Ace of Diamonds, Ace of Clubs). Using a stable sorting algorithm, when you sort these cards first by their face value (Ace), and then by their suits, the original order of the cards with the same face value will be preserved in the sorted list.

2. Unstable Sorting Example:
   If you use an unstable sorting algorithm to sort a list of employees first by their hire date and then by their department, employees hired on the same date may end up in a different order than in the original list.
